# UFOs
## Overview of Project
In this challenge I have built a dynamic webpage. Dynamic web pages are pages that will accept user inputs and visually adjust to reflect that interaction. Dynamic pages had built by inserting JavaScript into an HTML page also draw on knowledge of CSS and bootstrap and explore some Chrome dev tools to test the code as we go. 

In more concrete terms, I had built a table to hold and neatly displayed the data  wanted to work with. Then I added filters of the table which lets users refine their search on more than one level. For location-based data for example, a user can option to view results located in certain countries, or even cities. Our table has been inserted into, and visually displayed by an HTML page. I used basic HTML, Bootstrap and CSS to build and style the entire page. I  also included an attention-grabbing header, article summery and brief article.
